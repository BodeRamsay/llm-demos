### LLM Demos

A place to explore some work with LLMs.

Start with [this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_pres_county.csv).

1. The site works as is, it correctly displays the percentages next to each name and does use a drop down to show all of the counties. 

2. Yes it did, I got it to center the results, and also add some style to the website. I also got it to sort the candidates in each county by total votes, with the most at the top of the table. After some extra prodding, I now have the website display a horizontal bar chart showing the difference in votes underneath the table. 

3. You could create a very similar website to this one with crime statistics if you have them in a similar format. Again, you can take the crime statistics file containing the total of each crime and ask the LLM to complete a website just like this one, or ask for different features for the website.
